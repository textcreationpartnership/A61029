            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I SHALL not (I hope I need not) uſe many Arguments to perſwade you to look about you, the Popiſh Clouds are gathered, and muſt and will fall: Matters of Fact and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truths need no Artificial Dreſs to re-commend them, but (to my unſpeakable Grief I ſpeak it) we live in a ſordid, degenerate Age; wherein Truth is under the higheſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and forced into Corners, the ſecret Places where poſſibly a few own it; yet I cannot but hope at laſt it will work its own way, and will overcome and ſurmount all malicious Arts and Diſcouragements. However Gentlemen, I am not a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, to ſee Men are more and more awake out of their Lethargy; I hope I ſpeak to true Proteſtant Engliſh Spirits, my way is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I do ſtudy it, becauſe I know Engliſh-men love plain, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Dealing. I ſhall not enlarge (though I could to a Volume) but will only, as in a Mirror or Glaſs, repreſent that you are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Popiſh Deſigns and Meaſures) to Bondage (worſe than Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian) and that of a long Duration. I ſet before you the Death or Life of the Proteſtant Religion, our Lives and Liberties; let your Zeal direct your Choice: the Stock is great, we muſt work while it is day, leaſt the Night of Popery come (its already darkiſh) then it will be too late, except we ſee by <hi>Smithfield</hi> Lights. The True Worſhip of God is God's Honour, and the greateſt Bleſſing on this ſide Heaven. It ought to be weighed how far the very Notional Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World leads Men to a Vindication of the honour of a Friend or Relation, it puts Life and Eſtate to hazard; then how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105594:2"/> more ought we, upon a much more truly Noble Account? It is a Title and Character, infinitely above the higheſt Titles the World can confer, to be called and ſtiled, <hi>The Friend of God;</hi> which none deſerves, nor can ever arrive at, but ſuch as vindicate and aſſert with their Blood the True Worſhip, which is God's Glory and Honour and our great Dignity and Priviledge, to be called to ſo Noble at Work and Service, which has its Reward in it ſelf and Crowns (that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fade) for the Conquerours Life, Liberty, and Eſtate, are only deſirable, as they are Inablements, and as it were Habilliments for this Glorious Warfare and but as Duſt in the Ballance, though great Temporal Means and Bleſſings thankfully to be valued and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Gentlemen, All thoſe are now in manifeſt hazard, yet only (under God) a Parliament can ſecure them to us: May we not fear, Gentlemen, that there are ſome about the King, who from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of their Actions are afraid the Parliament ſhould ſit; and labour to poſſeſs the K. with an ill Opinion of this People; but when the K. ſees the humble Deſires of his People in their Petitions, no doubt he will alter his Reſolutions, and let the Parliament meet in <hi>January.</hi> Let us do our Endeavours, and leave the Succeſs to Divine Bleſſing; therefore proceed without any diſmay: you walk within the Laws, and its your Birth-right and Priviledge, and the Kings Honour, to receive the Supplications of his People. The King of Kings delights that we ſhould come and draw nigh to him in times of difficulty and danger, and more eſpecially encourages us to do it. And as it is our Duty and Priviledge, ſo it's, if not the Kings Duty, his Dignity, to hear, redreſs, and heal the Sores and Wounds of his People. I have found ſweet Meditations in the Little Book of Martyrs (the Eleventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) of whom the World was not worthy, who deſpiſed the ſhame, preferred the reproaches of the preſent World before their Lawrels, Triumphs, and Preferments; having a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Recompence of the Reward. I do earneſtly recommend the frequent Reading of that Chapter, the more I read it, the more novelty I find in it; and it both kindled and bred in me ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, that I could chearfully ſacrifice my all (a poor all) it's only what God gave or rather lent; and it were the higheſt and blackeſt ingratitude, not to leave it at his Feet for his Glory and Honour, and the True Proteſtant Religion. I hope, by Gods Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, it may have the ſame effect and operation in you; it will be a <hi>Viaticum</hi> and Cordial in the Holy War, which is like to be not only here, but in Chriſtendom: for Popery or Proteſtantiſme muſt fall. Gentlemen, I have no more to adde, I ſpeak my mind freely to you, I adviſe you to do what I intend to do my ſelf, what-ever come of it. I know on whoſe ſide the Jails are, I may be committed; but I have the ſatisfaction that I have the Law as a Staff in my Hand to walk by. I am above the fear of Death, much more of a Jail; I hope all you are too; and therefore I will ſubſcribe: My Courage allows me to own the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
